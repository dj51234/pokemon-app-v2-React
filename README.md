## To-Do List

### Critical Tasks

1. **Re-evaluate Holographic Cards**
   - Ensure that the app accurately identifies which cards are actually holographic. Currently, all promo cards show up as holo, but not all of them are holo.
   - Implement a more accurate method for determining holographic status.

2. **Add Autocomplete for Pokémon Search**
   - Implement an autocomplete feature for the Pokémon search field to provide suggestions as users type.
   - Ensure the autocomplete does not affect the set search functionality.

3. **Profile and Collection Management**
   - Implement user profiles where users can save and manage their card collections.
   - Allow users to track their collection progress and see which cards they are missing.

4. **Pack Opening Simulation**
   - Develop a feature where users can simulate opening packs and add cards to their collection.
   - Include animations and sound effects to enhance the experience.

5. **Trading System**
   - Create a system that allows users to trade cards with each other.
   - Implement a secure and fair trading mechanism.

6. **Card Details and Statistics**
   - Provide detailed information and statistics for each card, such as rarity, type, and set.
   - Include high-resolution images and backstory for each card.

7. **User Interface Enhancements**
   - Improve the overall UI/UX design to make the app more user-friendly and visually appealing.
   - Ensure the app is responsive and works well on various devices.

8. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize the app for faster loading times and smoother performance.
   - Minimize the number of API calls and efficiently manage data fetching.

9. **Testing and Bug Fixes**
   - Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix bugs.
   - Implement unit tests and end-to-end tests to ensure the app's reliability and stability.

10. **Documentation and Tutorials**
    - Create comprehensive documentation for the app, including usage guides and API references.
    - Develop tutorials and help sections to assist users in navigating and using the app effectively.
